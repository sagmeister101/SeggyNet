## The Algorithm

SegNet is a deep neural network for semantic segmentation, employing an encoder-decoder architecture. It reduces image dimensions in the encoder, uses pooling indices for precise upsampling in the decoder, and classifies pixels into predefined classes with softmax activation. 

This model in particular is trained to recognize and distinguish human components. For instance, it can recognize a face, a shirt, or any of the classes of object listed below.
